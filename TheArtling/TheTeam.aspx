In 2013, as she was working on various interior design and architecture projects, she discovered that there was no aggregated platform to discover contemporary art in the region. Hence, The Artling was then founded to fill this gap in the market. Armed with an architectural and interior design background, Talenia previously founded her own interior 
                    architecture and design practice which she started after working for Zaha Hadid Architects for several years in London. Talenia received a BA(Hons) in Architecture from Central Saint Martin’s in London and is a Loke Cheng Kim Scholar. She is a design judge for Dezeen’s Awards 2020, previously served on Design Trust’s benefit committee for three consecutive years and was a Milken Institute Young Leader Circle member. She has also spoken at numerous international conferences and has been part of panels for UBS, DBS, The Milken Institute, Facebook, SuperReturn Asia, Dezeen, STPI and more. “At The Artling, we are merging art and technology in order for our artists and designers to reach as many people as possible, and to enrich lives through culture. Our technological innovations are aimed at improving both buyer and seller experiences, increasing trust and transparency, but also building social capital. Great art and design inspires, uplifts and changes environments. The impact of the 
                    platform goes way beyond just being a typical marketplace; they affect communities.” Talenia’s life passions are intertwined with the world of contemporary art, architecture and design.</span></div>
